# Wallet-Database
The program has designed to store incomes and expenses in a database. You 
can add incomes and expenses to the database. For each entry the program stores
the following data: date (year, month and day), type (income or expense), category 
(like household, food, party, travel, scholarship, salary, etc.), the amount (given in 
HUF).

#The program has following functions:
# load existing database into memory (create a new if there is no database yet),
# add new income/expense entry into the database,
# save the database (from the memory) into a file,
# create new categories on user’s request,
# display total expenses and incomes, the name of the most expensive category 
#and the money user spent for that category, and your overall balance (the 
#money you have) – this means evaluating all entries of the database,
# for a user selected time period (the user may enter the start and end date of 
#the period) display statistics for each category (total spent, total income, 
largest expense).
